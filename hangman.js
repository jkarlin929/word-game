// console.log("Here we go");
//get input from form and use .val to store it in top-left id

//use innerHTML from .val to put it into top-left id

//maybe a start button?
//add click event for each letter
//set variable to create array of words as possible solutions
//randomize through array of words and set that to randomized solutions variable
//split randomized word into characters(maybe?)
//if guessed letter is a match manipulate display css property from hidden to inline/block if character is in solution
//after each click event, if letter is in solution use innerHTML to make it appear in solution
//if letter is not in solution, animate the div of that letter disappear and number of turns decreases by one
//if turns is 0 then indicate game over
//have the letter change once it is clicked so the user cannot use it again
//if number of turns is over (At 0) then innerHTML appears(game over)
//if the solution is solved(all innerHTML matches the solution) then display you've won!
//write a function to check for a winner to see if all divs have a display of block instead of hidden OR set a variable that holds the total number of correct guesses and check if that number is equal to the total number of letters in words
